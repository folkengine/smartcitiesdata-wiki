# Prepare your workstation
In order to test and extend the Smart Cities platform, you'll need to install a few tools on your workstation.
While you may not need all of the following, end-to-end development of the platform will require each of these at some point.
* _Elixir_ - custom applications written for the project
* *Nodejs* - the front end user interface, using the Reactjs framework
* *Git* - source code management; cloning the projects and pushing them back up for review
* *Docker* and Docker Compose - local development and testing; application packaging and deployment
* *Kubectl* - Kubernetes cluster management and application debugging
* *Helm* - Application packaging and deployment configuration management
* *Minikube* - Local development testing
