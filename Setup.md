# Prepare your workstation
In order to test and extend the Smart Cities platform, you'll need to install a few tools on your workstation.
While you may not need all of the following, end-to-end development of the platform will require each of these at some point.
* __Elixir__ - custom applications written for the project
* __Nodejs__ - the front end user interface, using the Reactjs framework
* __Git__ - source code management; cloning the projects and pushing them back up for review
* __Docker and Docker Compose__ - local development and testing; application packaging and deployment
* __Kubectl__ - Kubernetes cluster management and application debugging
* __Helm__ - Application packaging and deployment configuration management
* __Minikube__ - Local development testing
