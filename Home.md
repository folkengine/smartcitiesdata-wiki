# Welcome to the Smart Cities Data Platform!

We're glad you're here ðŸ˜ƒ 

The goal of this wiki is to centralize documentation around the Smart Cities Data project and make it easier for the core team to maintain while simultaneously making it easier for you to learn about the project and hopefully adopt it for yourself and contribute back.

Read on to learn about:
* [What is the project and how it works](https://github.com/smartcitiesdata/smartcitiesdata/wiki/The-What)
* What all those application names mean
* How to run and use the code
* How to contribute
* How to contact the team
* Additional learning resources
* A glossary of terms and technologies

We look forward to growing a robust community around this project and doing some truly challenging and disruptive things in the space of Smart and Connected cities, industries, and organizations, IoT processing, and data analytics. Please join us and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out and ask!
