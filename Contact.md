# Need help with an issue?
If you've got a problem with one of the project repos or want to raise an issue you've discovered with a platform component, please create an issue within the Github repository of the component in question. If you have a question, are experiencing a problem with the overall architecture of the system, or don't have a good idea of where the problem is coming from, feel free to leave it here in the smartcitiesdata repo.
