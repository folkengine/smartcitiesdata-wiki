# We won't bite
The core team is happy and eager to welcome new members to the community. Please don't hesitate to reach out and contact the project.

# Need help with an issue?
If you've got a problem with one of the project repos or want to raise an issue you've discovered with a platform component, please create an issue within the Github repository of the component in question. If you have a question, are experiencing a problem with the overall architecture of the system, or don't have a good idea of where the problem is coming from, feel free to leave it here in the smartcitiesdata repo.

# Join the conversation!
For a more synchronous dialogue, the project uses Gitter.im as a community chat service. Slack is great, but it's not open and requires an invitation (or bot hack to automate the process) to join the community.

# Monthly Standup
As a proper Agile development project, the core team holds a "standup" video call once a month to keep the community updated on what we've accomplished and where we're going, as well as provide you with an opportunity to ask questions and talk about how you're getting involved. It is typically held the third Thursday of every month from 12:30pm - 1:00pm EST (UTC-05:00) via Google Hangouts. Reach out to a member of the team for the invite or check in with the community Gitter channel about a day prior for the meeting ID link.
